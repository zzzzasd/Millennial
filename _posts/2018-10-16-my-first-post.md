Gary loves eating pineapples and likes the toughness of the formation of the pineapple fruit – the spiky leaves and the rough body, while the fruit is juicy with an irresistible nice taste of sour and sweetness at the same time. and it has a crown on the fruit! 

He paints the pineapple series in his very unique carefree manner to depict a never say die attitude– the energetic stokes portray an ever moving positive energy of progress and perseverance when facing challenges and adversity in life. While in Asia, many believe pineapples or ‘ong-lai’  as it is pronounced in Hokkien represents the coming of a good fortune.
